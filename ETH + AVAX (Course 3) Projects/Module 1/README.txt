BasicAuction
This Solidity program is a simple auction contract that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to understand how these statements work in the context of smart contract development.

Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The BasicAuction contract allows the owner to start an auction, users to place bids, and the owner to end the auction. It uses require() to validate conditions, assert() to check for invariants, and revert() to handle exceptional conditions. This program serves as a practical introduction to Solidity programming and demonstrates how to handle common contract conditions and errors.

Getting Started
Executing Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps to get started:

Go to Remix:

Open your web browser and navigate to Remix.

Create a New File:
In the Remix IDE, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., BasicAuction.sol).
Copy and Paste the Contract Code:
Copy the code provided and paste it into the newly created file

Compile the Contract:
Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Ensure the "Compiler" version is set to a compatible version (e.g., 0.8.0 or later).
Click the "Compile BasicAuction.sol" button.

Deploy the Contract:
Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Select the BasicAuction contract from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Deploy" button.

Interact with the Contract:
Start the Auction: Call the startAuction function to begin the auction. This can only be done by the owner.
Place a Bid: Call the bid function with a bid amount. Ensure the amount is greater than the current highest bid.
End the Auction: Call the endAuction function to end the auction. Only the owner can end the auction.
Cancel the Auction: Call the cancelAuction function if the owner decides to cancel the auction. This will revert the transaction.
